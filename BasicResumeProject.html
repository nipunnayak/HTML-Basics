            <h3>Cricket Game</h3>

            <p>Cricket Game: Using the concept of OOPs, I declared many types of functions for different uses like one I used a bool function
                that deals with tossing, and another function that helps in selecting players for both teams. Currently, I kept only
                super over in this game, and for both teams, 5-5 players are selected, which can be adjusted afterward according
                to the user. The program is constructed in such a way that at first there will be a toss and the team which wins
                the toss can choose for bat or ball. Once both innings are over, the match summary is displayed on the screen
                declaring the winner </p>
